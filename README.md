## What is this?
This is a little web scraper/bot that I made to automatize my gym appointments so that I never again forget to book one and end up
looking like a fool. Along with cronjobs or a possible implementation of the 'whenever' gem it could be made to run automatically.
## Why is it so harcoded?
Because the point of the bot is to automatize my gym appointments and not require any input at all, I still added a method to cancel
an appointment if you run the script again and have a booked appointment.
## How to Run the script:  
1- Run 'rake scrape:run'  
2- Go to the gym  
3- Enjoy the muscles  
4- Find wife  
5- Have kids  
6- Live a happy life and die a happy man :D
